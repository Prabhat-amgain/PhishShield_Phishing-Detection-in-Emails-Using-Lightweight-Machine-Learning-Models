talking to an hpux kernelprogrammer to fix a previously unfound bug one time at 330 am with rare exception ive never found useful help at a manufacturer webpage ive definitely never received any help

of the algorithms be they for clustering classification or attribute selection etc i suggest take up a good text book which will help understand the fundamentals there are lots of great books available which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods some of which are implemented in weka here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights 1 to start with whitten franks book on data mining is a great one this is the book weka refers to there are also ones by han d hand on the same topic and widely used 2 for artificial intelligence russel and norvig or winston or knight or charniak are widely read authors in addition to all the books there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides papers articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy mit has a great open source tutorial most good universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read hope this should help regards subrat ________________________________ from mackmusdhbijzgslistscmswaikatoacnz

0,1,23,1,ppcwedbyff,gmail.com,pythondev pythondev summary draft april 115 2007 there were a good number of skipped threads but ive been out of the loop with a lot of busy things keeping me away from such things now that im getting back into it ill keep up with things again so let me know if any of the skipped threads should be brought in corrections and comments welcome as always announcements summaries about ssl tests an open bug about missing ssl tests 451607 was brought up to close or keep open jeanpaul calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a openssl s_server for testing purposes this sparked some talk about the terminating of subprocesses in a crossplatform manner see crossplatform subprocess termination contributing thread about ssl tests __ crossplatform subprocess termination because oskill only works on nix and os x platforms leaving windows platforms uncovered although subprocessterminateprocess exists for windows platforms it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use support was overall given for adding a unixonly signal method and a cross platform terminate method to popen instances nothing was said of actually incorporating these changes into the subprocess module although code was given contributing thread this was mixed in with the about ssl tests thread extended buffer protocol updates to the buffer protocol are discussed along with the proposal prepep documenting the updates for python 3000 but brought to pythondev due so the plans of backporting to 26 afterwards note i couldnt summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real degree but it is currently a py3k issue so maybe that is ok if no one wants to add to the summary it will stay short contributing threads extended buffer pep __ pep 3118 extended buffer protocol new version __ extended buffer protocol simple use examples __ function for counting items in a sequence a patch was submitted by steven bethard httpbugspythonorg1696199 implemented a discussed collectionscounts function to provide a mapping between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear there were suggested names but none overthrew the original counts and a question of items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a keyerror with 0 winning due to a justmakessense factor contributing thread function for counting items in a sequence __ context manager generator interaction a problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside the withblock raising its stopiteration but being caught by the context manager mechanics it was also responded that the problem would not exist without the use of overly broad try blocks and this lead to the addition of a formal note in pep 8 about keeping narrow try blocks contributing thread context manager generator interaction __ proposed whichpy replacement suggestion of replacing the whichpy script in the tools directory migrated to its proposal for inclusion into the standard library a patch and tests have yet to be provided contributing thread proposed whichpy replacement _ minidom and dom level 2 what is missing for dom level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and some work jumpstarted contributing thread minidom and dom level 2 __ test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose mode solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes before a waitpid call contributing thread test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x __ deferred threads previous summaries skipped threads checking pep autobuild results __ python 251c1 pickle problem __ build problem on windows unable to find getbuildinfo2c __ baseexception pickle issue __ summary of

everyone good with this or should i give it another day or two on 42207 calvin spealman wrote there were a good number of skipped threads but ive been out of the loop with a lot of busy things keeping me away from such things now that im getting back into it ill keep up with things again so let me know if any of the skipped threads should be brought in corrections and comments welcome as always announcements summaries about ssl tests an open bug about missing ssl tests 451607 was brought up to close or keep open jeanpaul calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a openssl s_server for testing purposes this sparked some talk about the terminating of subprocesses in a crossplatform manner see crossplatform subprocess termination contributing thread about ssl tests __ crossplatform subprocess termination because oskill only works on nix and os x platforms leaving windows platforms uncovered although subprocessterminateprocess exists for windows platforms it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use support was overall given for adding a unixonly signal method and a cross platform terminate method to popen instances nothing was said of actually incorporating these changes into the subprocess module although code was given contributing thread this was mixed in with the about ssl tests thread extended buffer protocol updates to the buffer protocol are discussed along with the proposal prepep documenting the updates for python 3000 but brought to pythondev due so the plans of backporting to 26 afterwards note i couldnt summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real degree but it is currently a py3k issue so maybe that is ok if no one wants to add to the summary it will stay short contributing threads extended buffer pep __ pep 3118 extended buffer protocol new version __ extended buffer protocol simple use examples __ function for counting items in a sequence a patch was submitted by steven bethard httpbugspythonorg1696199 implemented a discussed collectionscounts function to provide a mapping between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear there were suggested names but none overthrew the original counts and a question of items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a keyerror with 0 winning due to a justmakessense factor contributing thread function for counting items in a sequence __ context manager generator interaction a problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside the withblock raising its stopiteration but being caught by the context manager mechanics it was also responded that the problem would not exist without the use of overly broad try blocks and this lead to the addition of a formal note in pep 8 about keeping narrow try blocks contributing thread context manager generator interaction __ proposed whichpy replacement suggestion of replacing the whichpy script in the tools directory migrated to its proposal for inclusion into the standard library a patch and tests have yet to be provided contributing thread proposed whichpy replacement _ minidom and dom level 2 what is missing for dom level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and some work jumpstarted contributing thread minidom and dom level 2 __ test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block

textplain charsetiso88591 i saw that in version 334 also in latest jrip uses fastvector and when i saw running the weather nominal data 14 when the rule has two conditions humidity high and outlook sunny pruning of rule calls fastvectorremoveelementat1 which causes the size to be reduced but the objects are still held ie antecedents are not removed from object even though size is reduced to 1 if i look at the vector code it is public final void removeelementatint index systemarraycopym_objects index 1 m_objects index m_size index 1 m_size like in java vector shouldnt this be index uday next

which i use weka 357 as input i take data from a relational database below is a sample from this table stored in a mysql database each row represents an event id user_x event_y time 1 user_1 event_1 t1 2 user_1 event_3 t2 3 user_1 event_10 t3 j user_1 event_1 t_i j1 user_2 event_4 t_i1 n user_a event_3 t_z id unique for each row user_x user with x an element from the set 0 a identifying a user event_y event with y an element from the set 0 b identifying an event conneting to the database works fine now i would like to obtain the following format a userbased bdimensional vectordictionary of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value 0 or 1 indicating whether the event occured or not so duplicates are neglected for the sample table below with b 7 indicating that there a 7 different events numbered 0 through 6 this might look like id user_x event_y time 1 user_1 event_1 t1 2 user_1 event_3 t2 3 user_1 event_4 t3 4 user_1 event_6 t4 5 user_2 event_5 t5 user_1 0101101 user_2 0000010 i hope that someone can help me out kind regards guido budziak next part an html attachment was scrubbed url

3lc3x56n1hd3l476v90lx5ynph5zl4p639c3x56nbanmlvem07e2kadgecom contenttype textplain charsetiso88591 hi to get a handle on the algorithms and the basics behind each of the algorithms be they for clustering classification or attribute selection etc i suggest take up a good text book which will help understand the fundamentals there are lots of great books available which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods some of which are implemented in weka here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights 1 to start with whitten franks book on data mining is a great one this is the book weka refers to there are also ones by han d hand on the same topic and widely used 2 for artificial intelligence russel and norvig or winston or knight or charniak are widely read authors in addition to all the books there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides papers articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy mit has a great open source tutorial most good universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read hope this should help regards subrat ________________________________ from mackmusdhbijzgslistscmswaikatoacnz mailtomackmusdhbijzgslistscmswaikatoacnz

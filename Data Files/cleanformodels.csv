talking to an hpux kernelprogrammer to fix a previously unfound bug one time at 330 am with rare exception ive never found useful help at a manufacturer webpage ive definitely never received any help

of the algorithms be they for clustering classification or attribute selection etc i suggest take up a good text book which will help understand the fundamentals there are lots of great books available which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods some of which are implemented in weka here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights 1 to start with whitten franks book on data mining is a great one this is the book weka refers to there are also ones by han d hand on the same topic and widely used 2 for artificial intelligence russel and norvig or winston or knight or charniak are widely read authors in addition to all the books there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides papers articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy mit has a great open source tutorial most good universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read hope this should help regards subrat ________________________________ from mackmusdhbijzgslistscmswaikatoacnz

0,1,23,1,ppcwedbyff,gmail.com,pythondev pythondev summary draft april 115 2007 there were a good number of skipped threads but ive been out of the loop with a lot of busy things keeping me away from such things now that im getting back into it ill keep up with things again so let me know if any of the skipped threads should be brought in corrections and comments welcome as always announcements summaries about ssl tests an open bug about missing ssl tests 451607 was brought up to close or keep open jeanpaul calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a openssl s_server for testing purposes this sparked some talk about the terminating of subprocesses in a crossplatform manner see crossplatform subprocess termination contributing thread about ssl tests __ crossplatform subprocess termination because oskill only works on nix and os x platforms leaving windows platforms uncovered although subprocessterminateprocess exists for windows platforms it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use support was overall given for adding a unixonly signal method and a cross platform terminate method to popen instances nothing was said of actually incorporating these changes into the subprocess module although code was given contributing thread this was mixed in with the about ssl tests thread extended buffer protocol updates to the buffer protocol are discussed along with the proposal prepep documenting the updates for python 3000 but brought to pythondev due so the plans of backporting to 26 afterwards note i couldnt summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real degree but it is currently a py3k issue so maybe that is ok if no one wants to add to the summary it will stay short contributing threads extended buffer pep __ pep 3118 extended buffer protocol new version __ extended buffer protocol simple use examples __ function for counting items in a sequence a patch was submitted by steven bethard httpbugspythonorg1696199 implemented a discussed collectionscounts function to provide a mapping between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear there were suggested names but none overthrew the original counts and a question of items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a keyerror with 0 winning due to a justmakessense factor contributing thread function for counting items in a sequence __ context manager generator interaction a problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside the withblock raising its stopiteration but being caught by the context manager mechanics it was also responded that the problem would not exist without the use of overly broad try blocks and this lead to the addition of a formal note in pep 8 about keeping narrow try blocks contributing thread context manager generator interaction __ proposed whichpy replacement suggestion of replacing the whichpy script in the tools directory migrated to its proposal for inclusion into the standard library a patch and tests have yet to be provided contributing thread proposed whichpy replacement _ minidom and dom level 2 what is missing for dom level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and some work jumpstarted contributing thread minidom and dom level 2 __ test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose mode solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes before a waitpid call contributing thread test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x __ deferred threads previous summaries skipped threads checking pep autobuild results __ python 251c1 pickle problem __ build problem on windows unable to find getbuildinfo2c __ baseexception pickle issue __ summary of

everyone good with this or should i give it another day or two on 42207 calvin spealman wrote there were a good number of skipped threads but ive been out of the loop with a lot of busy things keeping me away from such things now that im getting back into it ill keep up with things again so let me know if any of the skipped threads should be brought in corrections and comments welcome as always announcements summaries about ssl tests an open bug about missing ssl tests 451607 was brought up to close or keep open jeanpaul calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a openssl s_server for testing purposes this sparked some talk about the terminating of subprocesses in a crossplatform manner see crossplatform subprocess termination contributing thread about ssl tests __ crossplatform subprocess termination because oskill only works on nix and os x platforms leaving windows platforms uncovered although subprocessterminateprocess exists for windows platforms it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use support was overall given for adding a unixonly signal method and a cross platform terminate method to popen instances nothing was said of actually incorporating these changes into the subprocess module although code was given contributing thread this was mixed in with the about ssl tests thread extended buffer protocol updates to the buffer protocol are discussed along with the proposal prepep documenting the updates for python 3000 but brought to pythondev due so the plans of backporting to 26 afterwards note i couldnt summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real degree but it is currently a py3k issue so maybe that is ok if no one wants to add to the summary it will stay short contributing threads extended buffer pep __ pep 3118 extended buffer protocol new version __ extended buffer protocol simple use examples __ function for counting items in a sequence a patch was submitted by steven bethard httpbugspythonorg1696199 implemented a discussed collectionscounts function to provide a mapping between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear there were suggested names but none overthrew the original counts and a question of items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a keyerror with 0 winning due to a justmakessense factor contributing thread function for counting items in a sequence __ context manager generator interaction a problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside the withblock raising its stopiteration but being caught by the context manager mechanics it was also responded that the problem would not exist without the use of overly broad try blocks and this lead to the addition of a formal note in pep 8 about keeping narrow try blocks contributing thread context manager generator interaction __ proposed whichpy replacement suggestion of replacing the whichpy script in the tools directory migrated to its proposal for inclusion into the standard library a patch and tests have yet to be provided contributing thread proposed whichpy replacement _ minidom and dom level 2 what is missing for dom level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and some work jumpstarted contributing thread minidom and dom level 2 __ test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block

clustering classification or attribute selection etc i suggest take up a good text book which will help understand the fundamentals there are lots of great books available which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods some of which are implemented in weka here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights 1 to start with whitten franks book on data mining is a great one this is the book weka refers to there are also ones by han d hand on the same topic and widely used 2 for artificial intelligence russel and norvig or winston or knight or charniak are widely read authors in addition to all the books there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides papers articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy mit has a great open source tutorial most good universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read hope this should help regards subrat ________________________________ from mackmusdhbijzgslistscmswaikatoacnz mailtomackmusdhbijzgslistscmswaikatoacnz

literature geology the ups and downs of stress brooks hanson the hawaiian islands have formed sequentially as the pacific ocean crust has moved over a locus of melting in the mantle as each island grows the huge weight of cooled magma a pile extending many kilometers above the ocean floor bends the ocean crust downward two related large mw 60 and 67 earthquakes struck the island of hawaii on 15 october 2006 and have helped reveal important aspects of this process both earthquakes occurred in the mantle one was particularly deep 39 km below the surface and implied local extension the other was shallower at a depth of about 19 km and suggested lateral compression through finiteelement modeling mcgovern shows that the different mechanisms reflect modification of the broad bending process by the different strengths of the lower crust and mantle producing compression at depths shallower than about 32 km and extension below with strain focused near the depth of the deeper quake in addition compression at a depth of 19 km would tend to restrict the ascent of magmas consistent with the notion that the crust is being underplated by cooled magmas at this depth bh geophys res lett

cells using a genomewide mutational analysis of potato spindle tuber viroid pstvd which replicates in the host cells nucleus zhong et al have investigated what these two processes share in terms of structural motifs potatoes produced by plants infected by this viroid are smaller and lumpier than usual and the viroids move through the leaf cells into the phloem and then on to distant parts the pstvd rna adopts a rodshaped structure and all of the loops were essential for fully successful replication and trafficking loops toward one end of the rod and in the middle were critical for replication damage to loop 11 produced viroids able to travel well but not so apt to replicate finally one loop in its native state actually seemed to repress replication comparisons with other types

concept of an energy gap that separates conducting electrons from localized valence states is fundamental to understanding the materials optical and electronic properties researchers discovered in the 1980s that photons can behave in a similar way optical materials fabricated with just the right periodic structures exhibit energy or frequency regions where light passes through and other energy zones where transmission of light is blocked just as semiconductor band gaps lead to a wide range of useful technological properties photonic band gaps can do the same for optical materials researchers have assumed that in order to produce the photonic band gaps highquality crystalline materials are required edagawa et al present computational results showing that amorphous diamond without lattice periodicity can also exhibit strong photonic band gaps the results challenge the traditional view that photonic band gaps are strictly a consequence of bragg reflection and interference in which electromagnetic waves are scattered from various planes formed by a periodic atomic lattice thus a range of photonic band gap systems could potentially be synthesized from materials such as polymers proteins and colloids that lend themselves naturally to amorphous structures dv phys rev lett 100 13901 2008 physics profiles in charge ian s osborne the availability of highpower lasers emitting intense pulses over femtosecond and picosecond time scales enables the study of highfield processes such as photodissociation and photoexcition of atoms and molecules in the laboratory such processes are relevant across a range of disciplines from the study of photoinduced chemical reactions in the atmosphere to the more fundamental probing of the electronic excitations in atoms when an intense laser pulse hits a cloud of atoms or molecules the intensity profile of the laser pulse will produce a specific distribution of ions after exciting a cloud of xe atoms with intense laser pulses strohaber and uiterwaal implement a timeofflight technique that samples the pulse focal region with micrometer resolution allowing the distribution of ions to be mapped out in three dimensions on the flip side the profile of the ion distributions can be used as an intensity sensor to aid the characterization and optimization of intense laser pulses iso phys rev lett 100

and computation they have pooled transcriptome proteinprotein interaction structural and evolutionrelated data to generate a dynamic model of the halophilic organism halobacterium salinarum this model was trained on data sets that included more than 200 microarray experiments measuring responses to genetic perturbations and environmental factors oxygen sunlight transition metals ultraviolet radiation and desiccation and rehydration the model known as egrin environment and gene regulatory influence network represents transcriptional regulation for 1929 of the 2400 genes in h salinarum and it was used to predict transcriptional changes after environmental or genetic perturbations or combinations thereof that had been held out of the training data sets as an example the gene nhac3 encodes a na extrusion pump that allows this organism to grow under highsalt conditions analyses of a map of proteindna interactions generated from chipchip data could not dissect which of five possible transcriptional regulators governed expression of the gene yet one of these was predicted by egrin to have the strongest effect which was confirmed in laboratory experiments bj cell 131 1354 2007 environment the debt of nations caroline ash tracking the worldwide depletion of ecosystem resources is a complex international problem srinivasan et al have used a simplified accounting framework to link populations who experience ecological damage to those who cause it the largest and most blatant imbalance is the debt we highincome countries owe to lowincome countries because of climate change on a per capita basis people in highincome countries are responsible for almost six times more greenhouse gas emissions than their lowincome counterparts included in the tally is for instance the luxury debt accrued by highincome consumers of farmed shrimp this demand encourages the destruction of coastal mangrove trees to clear the way for shrimp ponds the resulting loss of storm protection is increasing the risk to adjacent cities as sea levels rise and coral reefs collapse see also grimm et al review p 756 similarly middleand highincome countries consume most of the worlds fish nevertheless several fooddeficient african countries charge only modest access fees for the mining of their rich offshore fisheries despite the difficulties of measurement and the need to

essentials about glutamate transporters elizabeth m adler although three vesicular glutamate transporters vgluts have been identified only two are found in identified glutamatergic neurons in contrast vglut3 is expressed in several populations of neurons that release other classical neurotransmitters including inhibitory gabaergic interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex seal et al found that mice lacking vglut3 were profoundly deaf they failed to show a startle response to loud noises and did not exhibit auditory evoked potentials electrophysiological analysis revealed a defect in signaling from the inner hair cells ihcs of the cochlea to the auditory nerve and morphological analysis showed abnormalities of ihc synapses immunofluorescence revealed that vglut3 was present in synaptic regions of the ihcs of wildtype mice whereas the conductances in the ihcs of the mice lacking vglut3 resembled those in wildtype mice electrophysiological analysis indicated that these neurons failed to release glutamate the authors conclude that vglut3 is essential for hearing and plays an important role in the regulation of cortical excitability ema neuron 57 263 2008 unsubscribe

0,0,23,1,bfjbt,cdmon.com,re permission denied while using pipe in mastercf hi the shellscript part was a different attempt to make it work as the perl code always says 0 messages when its not true i thought it was something about permissions and the shellscript part just confirmed that alls the perl vars including mailbox contain the right value ive tried different owners for the pl file and all kind of permissions including suid and perl always says 0 and shell always says permission denied what about permissions is vmail user ok for the filter what combination of permissions i have to set up to make it work thanks enna mouss ha escrit jordi moles wrote hi everyone ive this in my mastercf filtres filtres unix n n pipe flagsr uservmail argvetcpostfixfiltrespl localhost10020 sender recipient this works just fine but depending on the content of the perl script i get a permission denied in the log file and the mail is returned to the sender for example if i do this my output1binls mntglustermailboxcur usrbinwc this is not perl its sherl i hope you only tried this to debug your script if you dont need perl then dont use it use maildrop or something like that or this my dir mntglustermailboxnew chdir dir my files my numfinalcurscalarfiles my list my count intlist should do provided mailbox is correctly defined and the script has the right to list the files the thing is that im trying to count how many mails there are in the new folder when a mail arrives im using debian etch and ive tried to chmod the file to 777 or even give it 4777 with the suid but it always fails ive also tried to make the owner root or vmail or many other things i dont get it right dont try random things instead collect the right infos print the value of mailbox to logs or whatever so that you see what it is ls la mntglustermailbox etc is there a way to get through this or maybe another system to count the number of files in the inbox everytime a mail arrives thank you

science about the journal this week in science volume 319 issue 5864 cities dated february 8 2008 is now available at httpwwwsciencemagorgcontentvol319issue5864twisdtl a copy of the this week in science section has been appended below this week in science february 8 2008 319 5864 this week in science quantum phase via geometry the phase of a wave function collapses when measurements are made so additional information is needed to determine phase and several methods have been developed based on interference with reference waves moon et al p 782 describe a noninterferometric approach to phasedetermination based on the isospectrality which describes pairs of simple polygonal shapes that have the same frequency responsethat is if these shapes were drumheads they could sound the same and be indistinguishable the authors used scanning tunneling microscopy to position co molecules on the cu111 surface at cryogenic temperatures to bound isospectral shapes despite the imperfect nature of this boundary the spectral fingerprints of the twodimensional electronic states in the terahertz range were the same within experimental error the authors then used this property to extract the wave function phase phase extraction should be possible in twodimensional quantum systems provided that the boundary shapes can be constructed credit hari manoharanstanford university spin hall effect of light hall effects manifest as the transverse movements of carriers of electronic current in the presence of an external field and recent work has concentrated on the spin hall effect in which the effects depend on the spin of the electron and not just its charge hosten and kwiat p 787 published online 10 january see the perspective by resch now report on the observation of an optical version of the spin hall effect that developed a sensitive metrological technique capable of detecting displacements on the angstrom scale when light refracts at an airglass interface there is an additional displacement of the light that depends on polarization in this optical system the polarization of the light interacts with a refractive index gradient in a manner analogous to how electronic spins are affected by electric fields moving with the heat most materials have a positive coefficient of thermal expansionthey expand when heatedbut there are exceptions such as cubic zirconium tungstate which will contract over a wide temperature range silveri hexacyanocobaltate iii is a framework material that has highly underconstrained cocnagncco linkages goodwin et al p 794 find that over a wide temperature range this material can either contract or expand along orthogonal lattice directions with a coefficient an order of magnitude greater than that of most materials they attribute these large movements to the framework flexing like a hinged lattice of the sort commonly seen in garden fencing credit goodwin et al every step you take as we walk we expend energy not only in pushing off with our planted leg but also when our other leg decelerates as it makes contact with the ground donelan et al p 807 have developed a mechanical device to harvest some of the expended energy in this deceleration step in much the same fashion as hybrid automobiles utilize regenerative braking the device is light fastens at the knee and produces about 5 watts of power potentially enough power to charge portable medical devices bonds shaken and sliced soon after the development of narrowfrequency laser sources chemists attempted to use these sources to excite specific chemical bonds unfortunately the deposited energy usually spread around the rest of the molecular framework too rapidly for the chosen bond to break more recently studies have shown that if collisions with other molecules or catalytic surfaces occur soon enough after vibrational excitation reaction efficiencies can be selectively enhanced killelea et al p 790 see the perspective by mullins and sitz now take this approach a step further to show that by exciting the ch stretch in the chd3 isotopomer of methane just prior to collision with a nickel surface they can achieve a 301 ratio of ch to cd bond cleavage relative to a 13 ratio in a thermally equilibrated sample quantification of this selective scission required a technically demanding massresolved detection scheme of thermally desorbed products sounding out earths core earths solid inner core is predominantly a phase of iron at high pressures one important clue for determining the properties of the core is that sound waves passing through earths solid inner core propagate fastest along the northsouth direction which suggests that there is a preferred alignment of iron crystals belonoshko et al p 797 present numerical calculations which show that the bodycentered cubic form of iron is strongly anisotropic to seismic waves and can match the observed 12 anisotropy whereas the hexagonal closepacked form previously thought to make up the inner core is not mixedup microflora the relationship between an animal host and the complex mixture of microbes it carries in its gut is a delicate one and the exact role the host immune system plays in maintaining commensal homeostasis remains unclear ryu et al p 777 see the perspective by silverman and paquette published online 24 january examined the expression of antimicrobial proteins in the gut of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster although the key immune transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappa b nfb was chronically activated in the flies by indigenous gut microflora only a subset of nfbregulated antimicrobial genes was actually expressed because of transcriptional repression exerted by the intestinal homeobox gene caudal disruption of caudal expression resulted in the expression of a different subset of antimicrobial peptides as well as a dramatic change in the composition of the intestinal microflora that led to the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and loss of host viability what a tangled food web we weave both direct and indirect effects can mediate bottomup influences on the diversity and complexity of a food web bukovinszky et al p 804 compared the effects of two related plants domestic brussels sprouts and feral brassica on their aphid herbivores the aphids parasitoid wasps and the wasps secondary parasitoids to examine how resource quality affects food web structure and complexity in this multilevel trophic system differences in the resource base cascaded through the system via an array of direct and indirect effects and led to substantial differences in the structure and complexity of the resulting food webs a growing role for centrosomes genetic analyses of individuals with extreme forms of short stature can provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating human growth rauch et al p 816 published online 3 january see the perspective by delaval and doxsey have identified a mutant gene responsible for microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type ii mopd ii adults with this rare inherited condition reach an average height of 100 centimeters and although their brain is comparable in size to that of a threemonthold baby they are of nearnormal intelligence the culprit gene is pcnt which encodes pericentrin a centrosomal protein implicated in mitotic spindle anchoring and chromosome separation during cell division although the precise mechanisms by which the cellular phenotype produces the size phenotype remains to be determined it is intriguing that other inherited forms of microcephaly disorders characterized by small brain size have likewise been genetically linked to centrosomal and mitotic spindle genes credit rauch et al tipping the balance in t cell decisions in the thymus key developmental decisions are made that have farreaching consequences for the immune system perhaps most notable the commitment of thymocytes to becoming cd4 helper or cd8 cytotoxic t cells the transcriptional factor thpok commits thymocytes that still express both cd4 and cd8 coreceptors to becoming cd4 t cells but how is the alternate developmental option generated setoguchi et al p 822 find that cells that would otherwise be destined to become cd8 t cells can be redirected to the cd4 lineage by loss of members of another transcription factor family runx it seems that under normal circumstances the runx complex represses thpok expression and allows cd8 t cells to emerge the heme balancing act heme a component of several hemoproteins is required in aerobic cells for oxygen transport and storage hemoglobin and myoglobin electron transfer and drug metabolism cytochromes and signal transduction nitric oxide synthases however free heme is toxic so its intracellular concentration must be carefully regulated keel et al p 825 have generated mice lacking the heme export protein flvcr feline leukemia virus subgroup c receptor and show that this factor is required for terminal red blood cell development they suggest that heme toxicity may be a common pathophysiology in some erythroid disorders where freehemebalance is perturbed additionally flvcr functions in the recycling of hemeiron from senescent red cells and hemeiron trafficking via flvcr is involved in systemic iron homeostasis uneven heat gain recent global warming will not be and has not been uniform across all regions in order to predict more accurately what the impacts of warming will be the spatial pattern of temperature change needs to be understood lozier et al p 800 published online 3 january examined how the north atlantic has gained heat during the past 50 years the total amount of heat gained within the basin is approximately what would be expected but the tropics and subtropics have warmed while the subpolar ocean has cooled these results are interpreted with the help of an ocean general circulation model to be mostly the result of wind and buoyancy forcing associated with the north atlantic oscillation although the spatial pattern of temperature change in the north atlantic does not directly reflect global warming it may be the indirect result of warming as transmitted through largescale changes in atmospheric circulation nanoscale 3d imaging superresolution fluorescence microscopy methods are capable of breaking the diffraction limit of resolution in conventional light microscopy of 200 to 300 nanometers nm these techniques have improved twodimensional 2d image resolution but achieving 3d nanoscale resolution has remained a challenge huang et al p 810 published online 3 january have used an optical astigmatism method to develop 3d stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy storm they examined intracellular clathrincoated pits and microtubules with an image resolution of 20 to 30 nm in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nm in the axial dimension in fixed cells specifying gene expression the efficiency of gene transcription by rna polymerase ii is modulated by the composition of promoter chromatin including the presence of nucleosomebinding proteins using a genomic approach krishnakumar et al p 819 show that polyadpribose polymerase1 parp1 and the linker histone h1 two nucleosomebinding proteins that compete for binding to nucleosomes in vitro exhibit a reciprocal pattern of binding at many promoters in vivo at positively regulated promoters parp1 is bound but h1 is not thus promoter localization patterns of nucleosomebinding factors can specify global gene expression outcomes in vivo relatedness and reproductive success it appears that marrying your cousin may not be such a bad idea provided there is sufficient distance in the degree of your relatedness helgason et al p 813 analyzed recorded genealogies of 10 generations of icelanders to test the effect of relatedness on reproductive success marriages between third and fourth cousins produced more children and more grandchildren than marriages between more highly related or less related people icelandic society has urbanized during the past 200 years with rural populations moving into urban areas and the relatedness of married couples has diminished which has been accompanied by a drop in reproductive success unsubscribe or edit your subscriptions for this service at

consult with him who was set on the ds he did a pretty aggressive sell on distal rny to her she ended up choosing a different surgeon thats been quite some time ago now though the list at wwwduodenalswitchcom is the list of surgeons i would consider sound there are a lot of surgeons who will put themselves out there as doing the ds or having been trained in it when they truly are not prods at all ohs list is notorious for those types of listings i know they tried to clean the list up a bit about a year ago or so but its still concerning to me that so many people get fed a ton of misinformation about the ds when they contact some of those listed there maybe it would be a good idea to call their office and ask some pointed questions 1 does the doctor offer the ds as a surgical procedure 2 if so how many ds surgeries has he done total 3 how many open how many lap 4 how many lap ds surgeries has he done in the past year 5 how many surgeries that started out lap were converted to open 6 what type of postop followup does he have for ds postops 7 how many of his ds postops are willing to speak to prospective patients 8 can he share information about his feelings about surgical specs ie what size gastric sleeve does he leave what length alimentary limb what length common channel just to name a few best of luck dina open bpdds july 2 2002 dr aniceto baltasar in alcoy

crossplatform subprocess termination because oskill only works on nix and os x platforms leaving windows platforms uncovered although subprocessterminateprocess exists for windows platforms it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use support was overall given for adding a unixonly signal method and a cross platform terminate method to popen instances nothing was said of actually incorporating these changes into the subprocess module although code was given contributing thread this was mixed in with the about ssl tests thread extended buffer protocol updates to the buffer protocol are discussed along with the proposal prepep documenting the updates for python 3000 but brought to pythondev due so the plans of backporting to 26 afterwards note i couldnt summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real degree but it is currently a py3k issue so maybe that is ok if no one wants to add to the summary it will stay short contributing threads extended buffer pep __ pep 3118 extended buffer protocol new version __ extended buffer protocol simple use examples __ function for counting items in a sequence a patch was submitted by steven bethard httpbugspythonorg1696199 implemented a discussed collectionscounts function to provide a mapping between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear there were suggested names but none overthrew the original counts and a question of items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a keyerror with 0 winning due to a justmakessense factor contributing thread function for counting items in a sequence __ context manager generator interaction a problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside the withblock raising its stopiteration but being caught by the context manager mechanics it was also responded that the problem would not exist without the use of overly broad try blocks and this lead to the addition of a formal note in pep 8 about keeping narrow try blocks contributing thread context manager generator interaction __ proposed whichpy replacement suggestion of replacing the whichpy script in the tools directory migrated to its proposal for inclusion into the standard library a patch and tests have yet to be provided contributing thread proposed whichpy replacement _ minidom and dom level 2 what is missing for dom level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and some work jumpstarted contributing thread minidom and dom level 2 __ test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose mode solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes before a waitpid call contributing thread test_ptypy hangs in verbose mode on mac os x __ http responses and errors in 2xx http responses mean that the request was handled ok the existing library was specialcasing the most common responses and treating others as errors after verifying that there wasnt a good reason for the old behavior facundo batista fixed it contributing thread http responses and errors __ build problem on windows it is a generated file the actual problem is in make_buildinfo contributing thread build problem on windows unable to find getbuildinfo2c __ baseexception pickle issue exceptions are now newstyle classes this caused some obscure problems with picking and unpickling httpwwwpythonorgsf1498571 and later httpwwwpythonorgsf1692335 should resolve the issue contributing thread baseexception pickle issue __ deprecating baseexceptionmessage plans changed baseexception will still accept an args tuple so dont bother with the message attribute probably the shorted leaved python feature ever see pep 352 contributing thread deprecating baseexceptionmessage __ changes to decimalpy the external standard has been updated pythons implementation will be updated to match contributing threads changes to decimalpy __ fwd re changes to decimalpy __ pydoc rewrite discussion at docsig list an announcement that the normally quiet docsig mailing list would be discussing a rewrite of pydoc httpmailpythonorgpipermaildocsig contributing thread pydoc rewrite

coded changing it to yes makes clamdscan see it how ever the reason i saw it was because a message came in on mail server 3 last night and was not caught but the message was then forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan now mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when i checked it again but it obviously did last night when phishingscanurls no any reason for that that you can see rick

0,1,23,1,lngjjnbze,gmail.com,pythondev osrename on windows hi i have submitted a patch httpwwwpythonorgsf1704547 that allows osrename to replace the destination file if it exists on windows as part of discussion in the tracker martin suggested that pythondev should discuss the change currently osrename on windows uses the api movefile which fails if the destination file exists the patch replaces this api with movefileex and uses the flag movefile_replace_existing which causes the destination file to be replaced if it exists however this change is subtle and if there is any existing code that depends on current osrename behaviour on windows their code is silently broken with any destination file being overwritten but the functionality of replacing is important and i would like to know the best of way of supporting it if it is deemed that this change is not good to go in asis how about having an optional parameter to osrename say win_replace that can be used by callers to explicitly request replacing i must also point out that the patch uses another flag movefile_copy_allowed effectively allowing renamed files to be on separate file systems the renaming in this case is not atomic and i used this flag only to support current functionality it is not a bad idea to disallow such renames which brings it in line with the behaviour on many unix flavors this also has the potential to break code but not silently lastly i found an old discussion about the same topic by this list httpmailpythonorgpipermailpythondev2001may014957html even though guido indicated that he doesnt support api change in this thread i am posting again as i did not see any one mention movefileex in that thread thanks raghu _______________________________________________ pythondev mailing list zvlllneumpythonorg httpmailpythonorgmailmanlistinfopythondev unsubscribe httpmailpythonorgmailmanoptionspythondevpythondev40tangomucom

list messageid 120247552347ac5203bf83dwebmailhelsinkifi contenttype textplain charsetusascii but every once in a while i find a combination of parameters where the classification doesnt work at all and one sometimes even two classes seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like the following a b c classified as 0 6838 4 a inf025 0 6728 72 b 025075 0 2141 4952 c 075inf what can be the reason for such behaviour hi most likely this is a case of overfitting overtraining httpenwikipediaorgwikioverfitting especially in cases where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare the learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data that have no causal relation to the target function overfitting in backpropagation neural networks like mlp resulting in prediction bias toward onesome of the target classes can be caused by the following if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified iteration after iteration they get overweighted and actually take weight from the correctly classified instances ie the weights become imbalanced furthermore if misclassified instances happen to be clearly concentrated to some classes this can result in confusion matrix that you quoted zero correct instances for some classes i have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this mlp describes the parameters as follows learningrate the amount the weights are updated momentum momentum applied to the weights during updating decay this will cause the learning rate to decrease this will divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number to determine what the current learning rate should be this may help to stop the network from diverging from the target output as well as improve general performance as far as i know no offtheshelf formula exists for optimizing these parameters it is an interchange of parameters and the dataset if you are looking for a pattern in performance consider that the parameters operate together learning rate momentum decay so that the first two operate for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change ultimately the cost function will

0,1,23,1,rkijua-qjbmqrgqp,puzzling.org,re pythondev osrename on windows raghuram devarakonda wrote hi i have submitted a patch httpwwwpythonorgsf1704547 that allows osrename to replace the destination file if it exists on windows as part of discussion in the tracker martin suggested that pythondev should discuss the change does movefile_replace_existing mean the rename over an existing file is actually atomic i cannot find any msdn docs that say so and ive seen some that suggest to me that it probably isnt if its not atomic then this doesnt offer any advantage over shutilmove that i can see and in fact would damage the usefulness of osrename which is currently atomic on all platforms afaik even though it cannot succeed all the time if movefile_replace_existing miraculously turns out to be atomic then my opinion is this feature would be very useful and i would like a crossplatform way to do this in python this feature should not be called osrename which for years has done something else on some platforms and so changing it will invite unnecessary breakage a new function would be better or perhaps an optional flag i propose osatomic_rename also i assume this cannot replace files that are in use currently osrename on windows uses the api movefile which fails if the destination file exists the patch replaces this api with movefileex and uses the flag movefile_replace_existing which causes the destination file to be replaced if it exists however this change is subtle and if there is any existing code that depends on current osrename behaviour on windows their code is silently broken with any destination file being overwritten but the functionality of replacing is important and i would like to know the best of way of supporting it if it is deemed that this change is not good to go in asis how about having an optional parameter to osrename say win_replace that can be used by callers to explicitly request replacing id be ok with a flag but it should have a crossplatform name require_atomic or replace or something like that i think a new function makes more sense though i must also point out that the patch uses another flag movefile_copy_allowed effectively allowing renamed files to be on separate file systems the renaming in this case is not atomic and i used this flag only to support current functionality it is not a bad idea to disallow such renames which brings it in line with the behaviour on many unix flavors this also has the potential to break code but not silently i dont quite follow what youre saying here but id be against an operation called rename that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasnt lastly i found an old discussion about the same topic by this list httpmailpythonorgpipermailpythondev2001may014957html even though guido indicated that he doesnt support api change in this thread i am posting again as i did not see any one mention movefileex in that thread does movefileex solve the atomicity problem that guido raised in that thread i dont think it does so i think the situation is still the same andrew _______________________________________________ pythondev mailing list zvlllneumpythonorg httpmailpythonorgmailmanlistinfopythondev unsubscribe httpmailpythonorgmailmanoptionspythondevpythondev40tangomucom

0,1,23,1,azc.hecxjaq,gmail.com,spambayesdev i used spambayes for class project thanks hi spambayes developers i just wanted to let you know that i used spambayes for my term project in my machine learning class and to say thanks i thought there might be some academic interest here and that id share with the list in return for the great code of yours that i used the overall assignment was to do something with evolutionary algorithms the goal of my project was more or less to attack a spam filter and attempt to use an ea to find weaknesses it might have i set up a blind watchmaker sort of natural selection evolution environment using a spambayes filter that i had trained on an old training corpus as the fitness function the program i wrote attempted to evolve a generic formula that worked sort of like madlibs to write spam emails that could get past the filter i started off with almost zero knowledge of how a spam filter works and tried to keep it that way while i wrote the algorithm so that it would be as naive as possible ive since read up on spambayes and some of the math behind it and it looks really interesting im looking forward to taking more time to look through the codebase now that the project is completed i see where i could have trained the filter on different content or parts of the evolution structure that i could have written differently to make this project more successful but thats research for you this was a very quick proof of concept project and if i were to continue with this research there are certainly a lot of things i would do differently and many more complicated techniques that id like to try if anyone is interested in reading about the project in more detail ive posted the paper i wrote here httpwwwcsbrandeiseduegiffordclassesegiffordtermprojectpdf thanks again for maintaining this cool project i hope youll take my contribution in the intellectual sense that is intended and not as an attack liz gifford _______________________________________________ spambayesdev mailing list bsfegmjrrhnqpythonorg httpmailpythonorgmailmanlistinfospambayesdev

lost the powerful ssp01 dkimall protection against 3rd party fraud speaking about ssp02 im not sure how you see weve lost that protection in 01 dkimall specifically allowed 3ps thirdparty signatures so arguably it was weaker before under ssp02 a receiver could decide that 3ps should be treated more harshly where more harshly doesnt necessarily mean discard it could just mean do content scanning on the message we did remove all discussion of 3ps the extended list discussion around them made it clear that we just dont have enough operational knowledge at this time to understand how they should work as such we are now leaving all interpretation of 3rd party signatures up to the receiver that doesnt mean weve necessarily lost the ability to handle 3ps in a distinct way but it will have to go into another document at least for now the never concept can still be covered using dkimdiscardable and a null dkim public key the exclusive concept can still be covered using dkimdiscardable except that discardable doesnt prohibit 3ps it doesnt even say that messages without any signatures must or even should be discarded all it says is how the purported author domain views the messages that it sends out the furthest it goes is to say that the purported author domain encourages the recipients to discard it but anything related to 3rd party signers was completely eliminated in ssp02asp even though ssp02 dkimall is a always sign for 1st party authors concept it is basically a dkimdiscardable without semantics on rejection dkimdiscardable failures is explicit with the rejection control dkimall failures are not ssp02 dkimall is not a always sign for 1st party authors concept it doesnt even mention first parties any more than it mentions 3rd parties all it says is when the message left my control i had signed it it says absolutely nothing about how the receiver should handle the message similarly and as noted above dkimdiscardable makes no normative assertions about what the receiver should do with the message it is impossible to say anything about when the receiver should reject messages without stepping into the forbidden territory of forcing a certain behavior on the receiver in short dkimall is the spf version of softfail where you can record it but you do not take any rejection action on it just like spf theres nothing that prevents the recipient from rejecting messages under a dkimall condition in fact if we did it as intended there is no normative language anywhere in ssp02 about how the receiver should process messages be they signed unsigned or 3ps but that is not the case with dkim here we have 100 detectable fraud capabilities that is unrelated to legitimate multiple hope ip issues and asp is mandating a flawed inherent policy that receivers should ignore certain kinds of obvious fraudulent messages im not speaking to asp but ssp02 makes or is intended to make no normative restrictions on when the receiver should accept or reject any messages another addition to ssp02 was the concept of the evaluator this was added purely to try to make it clear that ssp is merely one input into the decision process the evaluator decides whether to reject a message quarantine it do additional content scanning on it accept it without further scanning redirect it to the fbi post it on usenet or anything else it cares to do my hope was that creating an explicit entity that makes the decision and clearly declare it out of scope we would clarify the limits of ssp it is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience that new

textplain charsetiso88591 formatflowed eric i sincerely appreciate your response and i do hope you are on your way to full recovery from your surgery i had a hip replacement a few years back and it was the first time in a long time i was forced into a prolonged vacation from work it been a long road to where we are now a road where we tuned nearly every stone and discussed and even worked out there were some remaining issues but ones that i dont believe were not addressable the best i can describe the concerns is that we lost the potential for protocol consistency fraud for example you pointed out ssp01 dkimall offered 3rd party signatures and this could be deemed weaker i agree with that point however i never indicated that a valid 3rd party was ever classified as secured but the lack of one is were the power of the concept is found the concept is really nothing new compare to other fraud detection concepts things we all do in some form or another include smtp a simple example is a traffic cop requesting and analyzing your driver license the officer is first going to make sure that the attributes indicated on the card matches what he sees in person if the driver is a 20 year old woman and the license says 60 year old man then this among other thing he can compare raises a red flag anything that doesnt conform to expectations is always the first thing people notice as you know this is a basic model in lots of things we do in our smtp world an excellent example is port 25 and its relaxed smtp compliance versus port 587 and its strict smtp compliance requirements ie ehlo checking under port 25 is recognized as low benefit for many historical reasons under port 587 ehlo correctness is a requirement same with other expects between the two protocols in short port 587 has less tolerance towards legacy operations by design you must login you must have certain headers etc even in standard smtp port 25 operations we have basic x822 header requirements that some systems may be very strict about if they dont exist in the data block or post smtp processing but there is no bcp for this but with dkimssp we can take control of this now and not allow it to become yet another relaxed protocol so again the power here is in protocol inconsistency fraud detection once things are all compliant then the other things comes into play because there is really not much more dkimssp can do from this point this is where other layers may come into play including reputation ideas and anything else i never argued against reputation i just felt that one group was trying to based dkimssp on it only and not even given the ssp concept a chance unfortunately the entire process has been commandeered in what appears to be a strategic goal to simply water it down to a level of total uselessness so to me the idea of an evaluator would be first a fundamental protocol consistency evaluator that would be part of the dkimssp framework across all supportivecompliant systems it would be 100 independent from any subjective or heuristics or reputation analysis or any one group detecting their questionable inherent policies or implementations methods it really has nothing to do with good guys vs bad guys because as we know bad guys too can exhibit compliant behavior but that is we want here we want to make sure everyone bad and good are all playing in the same field of following the basic fundamental protocol just like we expect with other any standard clientserver communications protocol we want this model because if we cant expect compliance with the good than we cant expect it from the bad and if we allow dkimssp to become this we would be back to square one of relaxed smtp legacy transactions where receivers lack enforcement and know hows but more importantly has no new information to rely on beyond the normal level of operations to consider dkimssp changes all that this is what lead me to technology and i of the belief this will be a major benefit for the smtp industry but this is only going to work with a standard protocol out of the box all must follow if they wish to implement it i think this is all separate from having extra evaluators ie reputations spamassassin etc if we start with standard relaxed higher level system then we will have lost an unique opportunity we havent had in smtp thanks sincerely hector santos cto

everything you are saying in your response perhaps because i havent been able to get through the nearly 500 messages that came in while i was recuperating i finally concluded that i had to just jump in but i am missing some context thanks for your example on smtp vs submit that gives me a good handle on what you mean by relaxed protocol but im not understanding protocol consistency fraud i think they are connected but i dont understand how and how ssp02 makes it easier vs ssp01 so far as i am aware the ssp02 protocol is no weaker than in ssp01 what is weaker normative requirements on how the receiver interprets that protocol which is inevitable if you buy into the idea that ssp has no right to impose any requirements on the receivers if youre disagreeing with that premise then i fully understand this is just a case where you have to choose one and go with it because you cant have it both ways as i said before my position is that as desirable as it may seem to put requirements on the receiver in order to guarantee consistent results the reality is that the receivers will do whatever they want to in order to give the best results for themselves and their customers hence saying no normative requirements for receivers is in my mind just bowing to an inevitable reality this is at the root of eliminating the concept of 3rd party signatures they were only relevant in terms of how the receiver interprets the dkim results and hence inappropriate for discussion you say some things about the evaluator that lead me to believe that youve got a different idea of what it should be than i do you say so to me the idea of an evaluator would be first a fundamental protocol consistency evaluator that would be part of the dkimssp framework across all supportivecompliant systems it would be 100 independent from any subjective or heuristics or reputation analysis or any one group detecting their questionable inherent policies or implementations methods this is the inverse of the model in my head where the evaluator is completely dependent on subjective or heuristics or reputation analysis it is in short how the receiver decides how to process the message indeed the point of introducing the concept is an attempt to make explicit what is out of scope for normative definition in the ssp spec if im misunderstanding what you are trying to say very possible then i apologize

the word discardable we used it in ssp02 because it matched asp it has occurred to me that weve spent far too much time arguing about exactly what word to use im deeply tempted to switch to numbers special characters or random gibberish strings so that people have to read the actual description its an assertion that the sender would prefer that the recipient not deliver some small fraction of legitimate email as well as some small fraction of illegitimate email rather than delivering those small fractions of legitimate and illegitimate email in the senders opinion it is more important that mail claiming to be from them not be delivered than for it to be delivered the english meaning of discardable matches the semantics pretty well if we want implementors to easily understand and deploy the specification and more importantly the limits of them doing so thats fairly important cheers steve _______________________________________________ note well this list operates according to end of

0,1,0,2,lmidjp-fuve,list.moveon.org,mccain dear moveon member after super tuesdays results and yesterdays news that governor mitt romney dropped out of the presidential race its clear that senator john mccain will be the republican nominee and while the election is a long way off hes running neck and neck with clinton and obama in national polls thats because when people think of mccain they think of the media portrayal as a maverickthey dont think of him as the man who helped george bush launch the iraq war but a new memo from votevetsorg shows that when it comes to the war in iraq john mccain has been the presidents greatest ally from the getgoand most striking is the fact that his plan for iraq going forward is the same as bushs stay indefinitely take a moment to read the memo belowyou wont regret it then were asking folks to get the word outcan you pledge to pass it on to your friends and colleagues the more people that know about mccains positions the better yes ill pass this on to my friends no sorry im also copying the memo below this email so you can read it here thanks for all you do nita marika joan karin and the moveonorg political action team friday february

memo is posted on their site here httpwwwvotevetsorg heres the memo senator john mccain presents himself as a maverick and a critic of the iraq war but a close read of his record indicates that his position on the iraq war has consistently matched president george w bushs before the war mccain used many of the same arguments as donald rumsfeld vice president cheney and president bush when advocating going to war with iraq o mccain cosponsored the use of force authorization that gave president george w bush the green lightand a blank checkfor going to war with iraq sj res 46 10302 mccain argued saddam was a threat of the first order senator mccain said that a policy of containing iraq to blunt its weapons of mass destruction program is unsustainable ineffective unworkable and dangerous mccain i believe iraq is a threat of the first order and only a change of regime will make iraq a state that does not threaten us and others and where liberated people assume the rights and responsibilities of freedom speech to the center for strategic international studies 21303 mccain echoed bush and cheneys rationale for going to war mccain its going to send the message throughout the middle east that democracy can take hold in the middle east fox hannity colmes 22103 o mccain echoed bush and cheneys talking points that the us would only be in iraq for a short time mccain its clear

believe that the success will be fairly easy we will still lose some american young men or women cnn 92402 during the war senator mccain praised donald rumsfeld as late as may 12 2004 after the abu ghraib scandal asked if donald rumsfeld can continue to be an effective secretary of defense mccain yes today i do and i believe hes done a fine job hes an honorable man hannity and colmes 51204 senator mccain repeatedly supported president bush on the iraq warvoting with him in the senate defending his actions and publicly praising his leadership o mccain maintains the war was a good idea at the 2004 republican national convention mccain focusing on the war in iraq said that while weapons of mass destruction were not found saddam once had them and he would have acquired them again mccain said the mission in iraq gave hope to people long oppressed and it was necessary achievable and noble mccain for his determination to undertake it and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end president bush senator mccain the war the invasion was not a mistake meet the press 1608 asked if the war was a good idea worth the price in blood and treasure mccain it was worth getting rid of saddam hussein he had used weapons of mass destruction and its clear that he was hellbent on acquiring them republican debate 12408 mccain defended bushs rationale for war asked if he thought the president exaggerated the case for war mccain said i dont think so fox news 73103 mccain has been president bushs most ardent senate supporter on iraq according to michael shank of the foreign policy in focus think tank mccain was at times bushs most solid support in the senate on iraq foreign policy in focus 11508 o mccain voted against holding bush accountable for his actions in the war mccain opposed the creation of an independent commission to investigate the development and use of intelligence leading up to the war in iraq s amdt 1275 to hr 2658 vote 284 71603 mccain praised bushs leadership on the war mccain i think the president has led with great clarity and i think hes done a great job leading the country msnbc hardball 42303 senator mccain has constantly moved the goal posts of progress for the warrepeatedly saying it would be over soon january 2003 but the point is that one we will win this conflict we will win it easily msnbc 12203 march 2003 i believe that this conflict is still going to be relatively short nbc meet the press 33003 june 2004 the terrorists know that this is a very critical time cnn 62304 december 2005 overall i think a year from now we will have a fair amount of progress in iraq if we stay the course the hill 12805 november 2006 were either going to lose this thing or win this thing within the next several months nbc meet the press

remove troops from iraq so that we can take the fight to al qaeda o mccain i believe to set a date for withdrawal is to set a date for surrender charlotte observer 91607 o mccain called proponents of a congressional resolution opposing the troop surge in iraq intellectually dishonest associated press 2407 the future senator mccain now says he sees no end to the presence of us troops in iraq o

0,0,19,1,larry,wall.org,re a few multiple dispatch questions on tue aug 05 2008 at 061730pm 0200 jonathan worthington wrote hi i am currently reviewing bits of the spec surrounding multiple dispatch and of course have a question or two ill probably have some more later as the dust settles in my head 1 the spec says a proto also adds an implicit multi to all routines of the same short name within its scope unless they have an explicit modifier if you write proto sub foothing sub fooint x only sub foo does this give some kind of error because youve declared something with only but it clearly cant be the only one because we also have a proto in there id consider it an error 2 if i write multi sub fooint blah 1 proto sub fooblah is thingy 2 multi sub foo 3 does 1 get the thingy trait or not because it was declared before the proto was im clear that 3 gets it i think a proto cannot be expected to work retroactively in fact i think its probably an error to declare a proto after a nonproto in the same scope 3 the spec says a parameter list may have at most one double semicolon parameters after it are never considered for multiple dispatch except of course that they can still veto if their number or types mismatch does the veto take place once the multiple dispatch has given us a candidate and we try to bind the parameters to the signature or as part of the multiple dispatch for example supposing i declare multi fooint a num b 1 multi fooint a str b 2 multi fooint a num b num c 3 what happens with these foo2 randomthingnew ambiguous dispatch error foo2 25 ambiguous dispatch error or 1 because 2 vetos foo1 25 34 ambiguous dispatch error or 3 because only one with arity match basically what im getting at is are all of these multimethods ambiguous because they all have the same long name and just because binding fails doesnt make us return into the multiple dispatch algorithm this is what im kinda expecting and would mean every one of these fails but i just want to check that is what was meant by the wording i believe veto is giving the wrong idea here as something that happens after the fact whats the term for only allowing acceptable candidates to put their names on the ballot anyway as tsa surmises the ballot is vetted or stacked in advanceonly those candidates that could bind are considered to be part of the candidate set in the abstract candidates that cannot match never get their names on the ballot though of course an implementation might choose to determine this lazily as long as it preserves the same semantics alternately even if the list of valid candidates is determined eagerly if the candidate list construction is memoized based on the typeshape of the capture it will generally not have to be redone until you see a different typeshape where the meaning of different may depend on how specific the signatures are and in particular on whether any of the signatures rely on subset constraints including individual values which are just degenerate subsets larry

programming part of the 20th annual acm symposium on applied computing santa fe new mexico march 13 17 2005 httpwwwsciunichit7ebistaorganizingconstraintsac2005 overview constraints have emerged as the basis of a representational and computational paradigm that draws from many disciplines and can be brought to bear on many problem domains scope the track is concerned with all aspects of computing with constraints including algorithms applications environments languages models and systems contributions are welcome from any discipline concerned with constraints including artificial intelligence combinatorial algorithms computational logic concurrent computation databases discrete mathematics operations research programming languages and symbolic computation we also solicit papers from any domain employing constraints including computational linguistics configuration decision support design diagnosis graphics hardware verification molecular biology planning qualitative reasoning realtime systems resource allocation robotics scheduling software engineering temporal reasoning vision visualization and user interfaces papers that bridge disciplines or combine theory and practice or discuss novel reasoning methods are especially welcome a special attention is focused around the use of constraint technologies in the networking wireless and internet fields submissions we would like to invite authors to submit papers on research on constraint solving and programming with particular emphasis on assessing the current state of the art and identifying future directions

unsubscribe from this email manage your newsletters february 8 2008 dear cnet members happy friday its good to be back from a long weekend in vegas i had a blast therenot only was the super bowl a great game all way to the last minute but also i was able to do a lot of other things like celebrate a friends birthday and a friends bachelor party and even got to go see a live ultimate fighting championship match talk about a fun filled guys weekend the only downside was while my mind helped me feel like i was 21 again my body said no way buddy so im still recovering but it was well worth it now its back to being a daddy and husband again ok enough about my weekend lets get started with richards question of how he can remove his hard drive partition this week we received more than 60 submissions to richards question in regards to removing his hard drive partition after reading all the answers a huge percentage of you recommended a utility called symantecs norton partition magic to get the job done second most mentioned was acronis disk director suite 100 while i have never tried any of these utilities ive always heard good things about them and how simple they are to use however these utilities dont come free and will set you back some money but if time is money and the fastest way to get around this issue is to fork out some dough i would buy it so to get you started here are a few selected submissions for you to get going but please read through the other members submissions some of you may come to realize that it might be worthwhile to wipe your hard drive clean and start over or just to invest in a new hard drive all together before any of you do attempt to go through with this task i would advise you to backup your data just in case anything goes wrong if

this request not just the latest update category none group none status open resolution accepted priority 5 private no submitted by david abrahams david_abrahams assigned to tony meyer anadelonbrin summary imaptte initial comment a patch that enables traintoexhaustion support for imap this patch has three parts 1 an __init__py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to ttepy this change is not represented in the patch file youll have to add __init__py yourself 2 some imap support in mboxutilspy 3 some refactoring in sb_imapfilterpy to sink the port selection logic into imapsession__init__ so that it can be used by ttepy in the process we simplify the uses of imapsession considerably this is probably not refactored in the best way in particular 1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilterpy and ttepy should be moved into spambayes or at least out of scripts however before taking on any major restructuring i wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure im on the right track comment by david abrahams david_abrahams date 20070526 0105 message logged in yes user_id52572 originator yes on cullext vs cull i was thinking it could be cullext but if getopt doesnt like that im fine with cull since tony isnt very active the thing got autoclosed but shouldnt the patch be applied if hes

cullext in general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in ttepy quite a bit thanks for that a couple comments the cullext cant work for both c and c maybe you should have cull cull with no extension to avoid conflict i made that change let me know if you have a different change in mind i dont know the sb_imapfilter code at all ill assign this to tony in case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch tony just mark it closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take issue with youre using psycopg classifier brave man skip comment by david abrahams

try it out a little at least before feeling confident about it ive only used it on imap folders and i wouldnt want to break the other use cases comment by skip montanaro montanaro date 20070509 1004

abrahams david_abrahams date 20070509 0033 message logged in yes user_id52572 originator yes that patch evolved yet again massively i implemented a version of culling for imap and refactored ttepy to

visiting httpssourceforgenettrackerfuncdetailatid498105aid1707808group_id61702 please note that this message will contain a full copy of the comment thread including the initial issue submission for this request not just the latest update category none group none status open resolution accepted priority 5 private no submitted by david abrahams david_abrahams assigned to tony meyer anadelonbrin summary imaptte initial comment a patch that enables traintoexhaustion support for imap this patch has three parts 1 an __init__py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to ttepy this change is not represented in the patch file youll have to add __init__py yourself 2 some imap support in mboxutilspy 3 some refactoring in sb_imapfilterpy to sink the port selection logic into imapsession__init__ so that it can be used by ttepy in the process we simplify the uses of imapsession considerably this is probably not refactored in the best way in particular 1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilterpy and ttepy should be moved into spambayes or at least out of scripts however before taking on any major restructuring i wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure im on the right track comment by skip montanaro montanaro date 20070526 0921 message logged in yes user_id44345 originator no ive already applied the patch i just assigned it to tony to remind him to take a peak if he so desires skip comment by david abrahams david_abrahams date 20070526 0105 message logged in yes user_id52572 originator yes on cullext vs cull i was thinking it could be cullext but if getopt doesnt like that im fine with cull since tony isnt very active the thing got autoclosed but shouldnt the patch be applied if hes not going to look at it file added spambayespatch comment by sourceforge robot sfrobot date 20070525 2120 message logged in yes user_id1312539 originator no this tracker item

elif opt in c cullext cullext in general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in ttepy quite a bit thanks for that a couple comments the cullext cant work for both c and c maybe you should have cull cull with no extension to avoid conflict i made that change let me know if you have a different change in mind i dont know the sb_imapfilter code at all ill assign this to tony in case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch tony just mark it closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take issue with youre using psycopg classifier brave man skip comment by david abrahams david_abrahams date 20070510 2018 message logged in yes user_id52572 originator yes great please give the code a onceover before checking it in it touches quite a few parts of spambayes and i dont want to step on any toes comment by skip montanaro montanaro date 20070510 1926 message logged in yes user_id44345 originator no i applied it to my environment ttepy and my strange

try it out a little at least before feeling confident about it ive only used it on imap folders and i wouldnt want to break the other use cases comment by skip montanaro montanaro date 20070509 1004 message logged in yes user_id44345 originator no dave do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the repository if so ill just make a quick review and apply it skip comment by david abrahams david_abrahams date 20070509 0033 message logged in yes user_id52572 originator yes that patch evolved yet again massively i implemented a version of culling for imap and refactored ttepy to greatly simplify it and remove redundancy hope you find that nice and not annoying file added sbpatch comment by david abrahams david_abrahams date 20070426 1703 message logged in yes user_id52572

submission for this request not just the latest update category outlook group 104 status open resolution none priority 5 private no submitted by mlarma mlarma assigned to mark hammond mhammond summary dep nx causes outlook to crash initial comment when enabling the nx function underneath winxp with sp2 rc2 32 bit edition not 64 bit windows i was unable to start outlook with the spambayes plugin after disabling and only disabling nx remove noexecute from bootini it worked funny thing is that the owner of the company i work for developed a bayesian spam filter as well and it had the same issue with the nx not sure what the problem is but the nx feature would be nice to turn on does anyone know if nx can be disabled at the application level so that the other processes were protected with nx mark comment by zian zianchoy date 20070604 0335 message logged in yes user_id1059620 originator no the dep nx issue is not restricted to athlon chips i am using an intel core 2 duo processor when dep is enabled via software in the system dialog in windows xp mce probably also applies to windows vista outlook fails to load the plugin the web page text needs to remove the processor limitation comment by jimmy retzlaff jretz date 20061207 2310 message logged in yes user_id101588 originator no ive tried a few basic python programs packaged with py2exe 065 and python 24 with hardware dep enabled on windows xp sp2 on a newer pentiumm with xd support and on windows server 2003 on an athlon 64 with nx support everything seems to work fine i tried all of py2exes bundle options and couldnt get windows to complain the python scripts i used for testing only do simple arithmetic and make use of easydialogs for windows which uses ctypes comment by tony meyer anadelonbrin date 20060205 0020 message logged in yes user_id552329 does that mean you predict that any py2exe program would fail to run if so im happy to put together a hello world program and attach it so people can verify that this is the case comment by mark hammond mhammond date 20060204 2306 message logged in yes user_id14198 just noting that the pythonwin issue appears related to the dde module and this is not used by spambayes im therefore back to suspecting py2exe comment by tony meyer anadelonbrin date 20051205 0047 message logged in yes user_id552329 a lot of people are hitting this these days so changing the summary in the hope that people will notice this bug and not submit new ones its already in the faq comment by mark hammond mhammond date 20050809 2231 message logged in yes user_id14198 just had a report that pythonwin also fails with this turned on this makes it less likely the problem is simply py2exe comment by mark hammond mhammond date 20050722 1106 message logged in yes user_id14198 another possibility is that py2exe is the culprit it isnt obvious to me that is is the problem but it certainly is possible it would be interesting to know if the source version of spambayes has the same problem when i get back to aus i will try and reproduce this comment by paul quinn paulquinn date 20040720 0804 message logged in yes user_id815032 this is a problem with nx protectionthis is how i got it to work there are ways to disable nx at application level a through the ui i control panel system ii click on the advanced tab iii under performance section click settings iv click on the data execution prevention tab v click add and select the appication you want to disable nx for b registry under hkey_local_machinesoftwaremicrosoftwindows ntcurrentversionappcompatflagslayers there are equivalent hkey_current_user keys create a new string key its name being the full path to the executable file you want to disable nx for the value being disablenxshowui youll notice that in the ui only executable files can be added this means that i had to select the outlookexe file to get spambayes to work again i tried adding the spambayes_addindll and the python23dll paths to the registry as a workaround but this didnt work also if you are using outlook 2003 you may need to reenable the plugin by deleting its resilliency key the com addin manager wont remember the reenable setting no matter how many times you try httpgroupsgooglecoukgroups hlenlrieutf8safeoffselmuz24fjzyfeha3984 40tk2msftngp10phxgbl fyi the same techniques work with inboxer etc im guessing as tim_one said its to do with the python libraries paul comment by tim peters tim_one date 20040709 1035 message logged in yes user_id31435 youll really have to ask about nx gimmicks on an athlon list spambayes is written entirely in the python programming language and that never ever tries to execute code from a data region im very familiar with pythons implementation my only guess is that outlook itself or mapi try
